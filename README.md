## IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Notebooks

Here I share all the relevant notebooks I worked with, during my experience with the [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science) available in Coursera.

Almost all of them were created by IBM in order to practice the content of each one of the courses.
Anyway, the notebooks posted here have all the exercises completed and also a further analysis, exploration and modelling made on my own, working this time with full datasets (in the courses we only used samples) and different models depending on the case.
